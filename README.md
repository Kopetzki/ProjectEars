### Developed by:

Project E.A.R.S. - Edin S., Ana A., Roberto S. & Steven P. .

## Product Description

The project **20 Together Minutes** is an interactive media web application where parents and children can spend quality time together while reading flipbooks or listening to audiobooks. 
    
The goal of this web app is to incentivize families to read and share educational material with children via a modern and interactive user interface. Since most children and adults spend several hours interacting with an electronic device on a daily basis, why not implement an application where substance can be offered? 20 minutes a day and parents are able to redirect their children's attention to develop the good habit of reading or active-listening. 
    
Using the *Django-React* tech stack as the framework, the web app offers a scalable model where new content can be added via the admin portal to be immediately rendered on its frontend page, visible to all public users. Its ability to store users is also present, whether it be done via an organic/user-initiated matter or via the admin portal which is restricted to the application administrator.
